Attendance and Attentiveness using Face recognition:
1. During the covid times, there's a sudden surge in online classes and meetings. And it's hard to keep a track of people who are attending the meetings or classes.
I mean we can take attendance based on Login data, but anyone can log in and easily give proxy attendance. 
2. And a much harder thing is, to keep an eye on students or attendees in the meeting. Most of the time students deviate as no one is watching them.
3. This project can be added to video call software with some changes, and it can take attendance based on face recognition and keep an eye on the attendees at the same time.
4. For attendance all it needs is a clear picture of all the persons who are going to attend the video call as input. And that's it. 
5. To check the attentiveness of the person in the video call, This bot counts the number of times they blink in a minute. After 5 minutes it'll warn if the minimum number of 
blinks are not recorded(Scientifically an average person blinks a minimum of 12 times per minute). I gave the threshold number as 8. So if this criterion is not met. It makes a 
beep sound for a second and alerts the host(we can arrange to send a personal alert to the host when this code is equipped for the video call Applications)
6. So if the person is constantly looking sideways or looking down at the phone. His blinks won't be counted which in turn leads to an alert sound.
